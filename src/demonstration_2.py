"""
You are given the values from a preorder and an inorder tree traversal. Write a
function that can take those inputs and output a binary tree.

*Note: assume that there will not be any duplicates in the tree.*

Example:
Inputs:
preorder = [5,7,22,13,9]
inorder = [7,5,13,22,9]

Output:
    5
   / \
  7  22
    /  \
   13   9
